MONAI (Medical Open Network for AI) is a PyTorch-based open-source framework for deep learning in healthcare imaging. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and utilities for developing and deploying medical imaging applications. MONAI simplifies the process of working with medical imaging data by offering a high-level API that abstracts away the complexities of data loading, preprocessing, augmentation, and model training.

This documentation will focus on creating a notebook that show an example of an end-to-end workflow of how to use MONAI's tools to in our research work of medical imaging analysis.
